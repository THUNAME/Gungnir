# [ICNP2025] FRPv6-Gungnir 🔍
This repo contains the official implementation of  [**"Gungnir: Autoregressive Model for Unified Generation of IPv6 Fully Responsive Prefixes"**]()






## Quick Start
We propose **Gungnir**, *a multi-protocol unified FRP probing framework based on autoregressive semantic modeling*. **Gungnir** captures the intricate relationships between FRP patterns and their influencing factors through a deep semantic learning architecture. It leverages *prefix inference* and a *granularity correction mechanism* to accurately predict and validate FRPs while avoiding errors introduced by incorrect prefix length estimation.

└── Strategy.py                     # Strategy execution script
```


### Preparation
- Import the IP-ASN32-DAT file into the ```data/20250123.1600.dat```.(https://archive.routeviews.org/route-views6/bgpdata/)
- Import the seeded data into the ```data/FRPseed``` folder classified by active type.


### 1. Generate Population Data
Run the following command to generate Population_Gungnir.csv:
```bash
python /home/weichentian/Gungnir/make_Population/make_Population.py
```


### 2. Train the Model
Run the following command to train the model:
```bash
python /home/weichentian/Gungnir/train.py
```



### 3. Execute Strategy
Run the following command to execute the prediction strategy (ensure Prediction/Prediction.csv exists):
```bash
python /home/weichentian/Gungnir/Strategy.py
```
